### Playing around with drupal and docker

I followed the instructions in this awesome [link](https://www.linode.com/docs/quick-answers/linux/drupal-with-docker-compose/)

I had to restart docker a few times for `docker-compose up -d` to work but you can always get verbose output with `docker-compose --verbose up -d` going forward a more permanent solution rather than restarting docker each time would be super better but here is a snippet from the end result.
